# Welcome To My Portfolio

## My name is Skye McCullough  

Thanks for visiting my page! I have utilized a variety of resources (such as React JS) along with the skills I have developed throughout my code school experience in order to create a portfolio where I introduce myself as a developer, list relevant skills, experiences and achievements, and share some of my work projects with you! I hope you enjoy learning a little bit about me and exploring some of my projects!
